✨🦕 Welcome to the Dinos! 🦖✨
We are a community of young cyclists organising weekly rides and regular off-the-bike socials, as well as larger cycling events. In doing so, we aim to create a space where everyone - regardless of fitness level, experience, or equipment - can enjoy cycling. For us, the focus is on the social side of things.
Our goal is to build an inclusive group, striving to provide a safer space from discrimination, where everyone can feel comfortable and welcome! 🚴‍♀🚴‍♂🚴🚴‍

Check out the individual group descriptions and join whichever sound interesting to you - but don't worry, all events will be announced in this channel. 📣
Being a community-led project, we actively encourage engagement and feedback! Feel free to join the Orga-related-subgroups to help organise events and bring your ideas into the community! 🦚
